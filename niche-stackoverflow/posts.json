The colors need to be inlined into the `fill` property. _(This is different than the .svgs we have on Website)_\r\n2. Convert the `.svg` to a react-native component.

 "body": "<p>The Run tab shows logs for the running app. You'll notice you can see the redux state in there, and that can be pretty nice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/59f60e5c-ab4c-4784-8156-973014accd34.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/59f60e5c-ab4c-4784-8156-973014accd34.png\" alt=\"Run tab\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Build tab automatically pops up, and, for a while, I didn't know how to see more helpful info. The build tab is sort of like a plain-english top-level summary of how a build/clean/make/run/sync process is going. It can be somewhat useful, and if you have the <code>Sync</code> pane open (the little tab looking thing up and to the left), then you can get slightly more specific messaging about build issues.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/ac52a4fd-350c-4892-af30-0af22d45186a.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/ac52a4fd-350c-4892-af30-0af22d45186a.png\" alt=\"Build tab\"></a></p>\n\n<p>However, the most useful part of the Build logs is hidden. In order to see the same type of logs that you can see in the terminal from running <code>react-native run-android</code>, you have to click this confusing little unlabeled button.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/29a78760-3f6a-421f-b396-46db46d3c7c8.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/29a78760-3f6a-421f-b396-46db46d3c7c8.png\" alt=\"Log button\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/1e007c6e-b7a2-4f82-b808-c27e9e33dbe4.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/1e007c6e-b7a2-4f82-b808-c27e9e33dbe4.png\" alt=\"terminal logs\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Another type of log that I have used is the device log, which you can see by clicking the <code>Logcat</code> tab.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/b0107770-cde9-4286-9433-1a6575b4475f.png\"><img src=\"https://stackoverflow.com/c/niche/images/s/b0107770-cde9-4286-9433-1a6575b4475f.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You may also want run the linter in AndroidStudio. You can lint code with <code>gradlew lint</code> command, or you can wait to see if linter errors show up in Travis, but... if you want to run the linter in AndroidStudio, it is not obvious how to do this.
